This repository contains my **personalized build and configuration optimized for the Asus Zenbook Duo**.  
Due to the unique features of this laptop (secondary screen, specialized touchpad, extra buttons and an asus pen), the entire setup and scripts have been adapted specifically for this hardware.
This build is highly specific to the Asus Zenbook Duo. Compatibility with other laptops is not guaranteed.


## Applied Scripts

- Touchpad and secondary screen configuration.
- Brightness and power management adjustments.
- Asus pen button mapping.
- Custom workspace and window management tailored for dual screens.
... I will be updating this as I add more scripts or modify old ones ...
